DATA TYPES
    Variables are used to temp store data in the computer smemory
    Escape sequence
        \ wil ignore the character
        \n newline in your code
        \t tab
    arrays
            int [] numbers = new int [5];
            number [0] = 1
            number [1] = 2
            when you print an array it prints the address in memory not the actual item
            there is a class called as arrays
            arrays.toString(numbers) - this will allow to actually print items vs just address
            {} - can be used to add all items of array at once vs as individual items
            int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5}
            arrays have a fixed length

Constant
    Final as initializer makes it a constant so value can NOT be changed later on
    final float pi = 3.14f;
    all caps for constant variables PI

arithmetic expressions
    + - * / %
    double or float for decimal
    ++ post or pre to increment determined by when you want to increment
    x = y++
    x = ++y
    agmented or compound operators are shorthand for changing the value for a var
    x = x+2
    x += 2

    Order of operations remains the same as regular arithmatic
    PLEASE EXCUSEMY DEAR AUNT SALLY

casting
    implicit casting - auto casting with no further things needed (under the hood)
   explicit casting- when you manualy tell it how to cast the different data types
   need to parse to mix types

MAth Class
round - round a floating to a whole number
ceil -the next whole number
floor- next smallest whole number
max- the greater of two values
min - the lesser of two values
random- generatins a random number betwen 0-1 returns double
    needs to multiply to make larger scope, and round to not have decimals and onl whole numbers
