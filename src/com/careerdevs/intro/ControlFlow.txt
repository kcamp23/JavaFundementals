INTRO:
    Comparison operators
    to comapre to see if they are equal or not.
    =
    ==- equal to each other boolean value
    != - not equal
    >- greater than
    >=greater then or equal
    <-less then
    <=- less then or equal


    Logical operators
        && and
       Evaluates the first statement first, only if its true does it move forward to the second one after the &&
       || or
        evaluates the first expression and decides if it is true. if first expression is true the second expression does not matter
        ! not operator. it will reverse the value of the boolean operator

        If statement

        if first booloan is true, the following statement is executed, and finish code block

       else if

       else
       as 3 clauses. expressions which need to be found true or false
       want to keep all clauses symetrical and indented correctly to keeep them easy to read

       you can only declare variable inside the code blocks,but then can not access variable outside of the block which it is declared
       you want to declare as many variable outside of code block as possible to be able to access them throughout the program and code

       set variable to a starting value
