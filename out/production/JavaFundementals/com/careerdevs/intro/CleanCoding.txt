CLEAN CODING

if you keep your code clean, breif and reusable it makes it more maintanable

restructure and make new methods

more then 20 or so lines you will need to make new methods
access modifier (public or private) static(belongs to a class rathre then an object) return type(void, itn string)
name(camelcase and name) () for parameters{} execute

public static void greetUser(String name) {
System.out.printLn("HEllo" + name);

}

REFACTORING
    changing the structure of the code without changing its behavior. Finding new ways to make your code clean, easier to read, and most efficient

    method should be between 5-10 lines of code per method
    limit is usually 20 at most

    seperate methods so they are cleaner but also so they can be used again in other programs and other parts of the code

    EXTRACTING METHODS
